          <p>
            With the progress of the times, cars have become an important means of transportation in 
            our lives. However, with new cars of all kinds, road safety issues still cannot be effectively 
            improved. While countries have responded by enforcing traffic laws and using electronic technology 
            to enhance enforcement, challenges still need to be addressed, including blurred images and 
            misjudgments by police agencies, and even exploiting loopholes in traffic enforcement frameworks 
            to evade consequences through bribery or connections. Exacerbating an accident and leaving victims 
            and families in the lurch of the aftermath.
          </p>
          <p>
            To solve this problem, we proposed a data traceability law enforcement system based on blockchain 
            and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). The system ensures rapid traceability and protects law enforcement 
            data from external attacks. The goal of leveraging blockchain’s decentralized nature and smart contracts 
            is to instill accountability and fairness in road safety measures, mitigate the effects of corruption, 
            and pave the way for a safer and more just transportation environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our experimental results show that under our stress test of 50 transactions per second, the throughput 
            can be as high as 300 and the maximum delay can reach 2.01s, which is enough to experimentally prove that 
            our system is feasible. Our approach is designed to solve the data corruption problem caused by the 
            centralized server being paralyzed. It applies to all technology enforcement, with high flexibility 
            and scalability for all participants to join or set privileges. we also provide an automated traffic 
            law enforcement system in a smart city. To make the data storage more secure and fair, and not easily 
            damaged by malicious people or tampered with by intentional attackers. This brings a breakthrough to the 
            country’s program security.

            <p>
              Blockchain technology originated from Nakamoto’s Bitcoin, 
              which uses peer-to-peer methods to collectively maintain databases in a decentralized and 
              trusted manner. Blockchain technology operates independently of third-party intermediaries 
              by utilizing decentralized nodes to store, verify, transmit, and communicate network data. 
              Each interconnected block contains the hash value of the preceding block, ensuring data 
              immutability once linked. Refer to for an illustration of the fundamental blockchain architecture.

          <!-- Hyperledger fabric. -->
          <h3 class="title is-4">Hyperledger fabric</h3>
          <p>
            There are four different types of blockchain: public blockchain, 
            private blockchain, consortium blockchain, and hybrid blockchain. 
            <a href="https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyperledger Fabric</a>
            is a type of consortium blockchain. It is an open-source project 
            managed by the Linux Foundation, designed for enterprise use. Compared to public and 
            private blockchains, it is more cost-effective, efficient, flexible, scalable, and secure.

          <h3 class="title is-4">Smart Contract</h3>
          <p>
            Smart contracts are just like automated programs that execute content 
            and enable applications when triggered by conditions within the blockchain.
            In Hyperledger Fabric, chaincode functions as the smart contract. 
            Chaincode is created and executed through peer nodes and comes in two main types: 
            endorsement system chaincode (ESCC) and validation system chaincode.

            is a kind of protocol called peer-to-peer. 
            It was proposed by Juan Benet in 2014 to achieve decentralized storage, 
            sharing, and persistence of files.
